	title = {Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2012},
	abstract = {The United States has a total land area of about 2.3 billion acres. In 2012, the major land uses were grassland pasture and rangeland at 655 million acres (29 percent of U.S. total); forest-use land at 632 million (28 percent); cropland at 392 million acres (17 percent); special uses (primarily parks and wildlife areas) at 316 million acres (14 percent); miscellaneous uses (such as wetlands, tundra, and unproductive woodlands) at 196 million acres (9 percent); and urban land at 70 million acres (3 percent). This study presents findings from the most recent (2012) inventory of U.S. major land uses, drawing on data from {USDA}, the U.S. Census Bureau, public land management and conservation agencies, and other sources. The data are collected for each State to estimate the use of several broad classes and subclasses of agricultural and nonagricultural land over time. National and regional trends in land use are compared with earlier major land-use estimates.},

Within urban/community areas, percent tree cover (35.1\%, {SE} = 0.4\%) is similar to the national value, but percent impervious cover is signiﬁcantly higher (17.5\%, {SE} = 0.3\%). Tree cover per capita in urban areas averaged 377 m2/person, while impervious cover per capita averaged 274 m2/person. Percent tree cover in urban/community areas tends to be signiﬁcantly higher than in rural areas in several predominantly grassland states, with the greatest difference in Kansas (+17.3\%). Most states in more forested regions exhibited a decrease in tree cover between urban/community areas and rural lands, with greatest difference in Kentucky (−37.9\%). These changes in tree cover varied signiﬁcantly among states, illustrating the roles of urban development patterns, management/planning interactions, and the natural environment on creating cover patterns exhibited in urban areas. Understanding these forces and patterns can lead to better planning and management activities to optimize the mix of tree and impervious cover to sustain urban functions while enhancing environmental quality and human health in urban areas.},

Fire, which has historically played an important role in defining the prairie landscape, may also play some role in breaking dormancy by producing a variety of biologically active smoke substances. The role of smoke as a germination cue was investigated in this study, during which the ex situ germination of 37 prairie species was measured in response to aerosol smoke treatment. Overall, one third of the species responded positively, while others were either inhibited or exhibited no response at all. Smoke may therefore play a more significant role in maintaining the composition and structure of tallgrass prairie communities than was previously realized.},

	abstract = {Seasonal pools, also known as vernal ponds, provide important ecological services to the mid-Atlantic region. This publication serves as an introduction to seasonal pool ecology and management; it also provides tools for exploring seasonal pools, including a full-color ﬁeld guide to wildlife. Seasonal pools are deﬁned as having four distinctive features: surface water isolation, periodic drying, small size and shallow depth, and support of a characteristic biological community. Seasonal pools experience regular drying that excludes populations of predatory ﬁsh. Thus, pools in the mid-Atlantic region provide critical breeding habitat for amphibian and invertebrate species (e.g., spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), wood frog (Rana sylvatica), and fairy shrimp (Order Anostraca)) that would be at increased risk of predation in more permanent waters.},

	abstract = {For decades, botanists have recognized that rare plants are clustered into ecological “islands”: small and isolated habitat patches produced by landscape features such as sinkholes and bedrock outcrops. Insular ecosystems often provide unusually stressful microhabitats for plant growth (due, for example, to their characteristically thin soils, high temperatures, extreme {pH}, or limited nutrients) to which rare species are specially adapted. Climate-driven changes to these stressors may undermine the competitive advantage of stress-adapted species, allowing them to be displaced by competitors, or may overwhelm their coping strategies altogether. Special features of insular ecosystems – such as extreme habitat fragmentation and association with unusual landscape features – could also affect their climate sensitivity and adaptive capacity. To help predict and manage climate-change impacts, I present a simple conceptual framework based on a synthesis of over 300 site-level studies. Using this framework, conservation efforts can leverage existing ecological knowledge to anticipate habitat changes and design targeted strategies for conserving rare species.},

	abstract = {Aim Identifying and protecting refugia is a priority for conservation under projected anthropogenic climate change, because of their demonstrated ability to facilitate the survival of biota under adverse conditions. Refugia are habitats that components of biodiversity retreat to, persist in and can potentially expand from under changing environmental conditions. However, the study and discussion of refugia has often been ad hoc and descriptive in nature. We therefore: (1) provide a habitat-based concept of refugia, and (2) evaluate methods for the identification of refugia. Location Global. Methods We present a simple conceptual framework for refugia and examine the factors that describe them. We then demonstrate how different disciplines are contributing to our understanding of refugia, and the tools that they provide for identifying and quantifying refugia. Results Current understanding of refugia is largely based on Quaternary phylogeographic studies on organisms in North America and Europe during significant temperature fluctuations. This has resulted in gaps in our understanding of refugia, particularly when attempting to apply current theory to forecast anthropogenic climate change. Refugia are environmental habitats with space and time dimensions that operate on evolutionary time-scales and have facilitated the survival of biota under changing environmental conditions for millennia. Therefore, they offer the best chances for survival under climate change for many taxa, making their identification important for conservation under anthropogenic climate change. Several methods from various disciplines provide viable options for achieving this goal. Main conclusions The framework developed for refugia allows the identification and description of refugia in any environment. Various methods provide important contributions but each is limited in scope; urging a more integrated approach to identify, define and conserve refugia. Such an approach will facilitate better understanding of refugia and their capacity to act as safe havens under projected anthropogenic climate change.},

	abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly recognizing the conservation significance of microrefugia, but it is inherently difficult to locate these small patches with unusual climates, and hence they are also referred to as cryptic refugia. Here we introduce a new methodology to quantify and locate potential microrefugia using fine-scale topoclimatic grids that capture extreme conditions, stable climates, and distinct differences from the surrounding matrix. We collected hourly temperature data from 150 sites in a large (200 km by 300 km) and diverse region of New South Wales, Australia, for a total of 671 days over 2 years. Sites spanned a range of habitats including coastal dune shrublands, eucalypt forests, exposed woodland ridges, sheltered rainforest gullies, upland swamps, and lowland pastures. Climate grids were interpolated using a regional regression approach based on elevation, distance to coast, canopy cover, latitude, cold-air drainage, and topographical exposure to winds and radiation. We identified extreme temperatures on two separate climatic gradients: the 5th percentile of minimum temperatures and the 95th percentile of maximum temperatures. For each gradient, climatic stability was assessed on three different time scales (intra-seasonal, intra-annual and inter-annual). Differences from the matrix were assessed using a moving window with a 5 km radius. We averaged the Z-scores for these extreme, stable and isolated climates to identify potential locations of microrefugia. We found that our method successfully predicted the location of communities that were considered to occupy refugia, such as rainforests that have progressively contracted in distribution over the last 2.5 million years, and alpine grasslands that have contracted over the last 15 thousand years. However, the method was inherently sensitive to the gradient selected and other aspects of the modelling process. These uncertainties could be dealt with in a conservation planning context by repeating the methodology with various parameterizations and identifying areas that were consistently identified as microrefugia.},

We tested this hypothesis in a deciduous forest ecosystem in the northeastern United States. We created an index that summarizes the collective variation in terrain and soil properties in 2-ha study plots. We measured woody plant species richness and diversity in 20 study plots that had high geomorphological heterogeneity and 20 plots that had low geomorphological heterogeneity. The richness and diversity of trees and shrubs were significantly higher in sites with high geomorphological heterogeneity than in sites that exhibited little change in terrain or soil conditions. Variation in aspect and soil drainage were especially important predictors of biotic diversity. Our results demonstrate an intimate association between abiotic and biotic diversity and have significant implications for long-term conservation strategies. Influencia de la Heterogeneidad Geomorfológica en la Biodiversidad I. Una Perspectiva a Escala de Parcela Los paisajes compuestos de condiciones abioticas espacialmente heterogeneas deberían proveer una gran diversidad de nichos potenciales para plantas y animales comparados con los paisajes homogéneos. Probamos esta hipótesis en un ecosistema de bosque deciduo del noroeste de los Estados Unidos de Norteamérica. Creamos un índice que sumariza la variación colectiva de las condiciones del terreno y las propiedades del suelo en áreas de estudio de 2 ha. Medimos la riqueza de especies de madera y la divresidad de 20 áreas de estudio con una alta heterogeneidad geomorfológica y 20 con baja heterogeneidad geomorfológica. La riqueza y diversidad de especies de árboles y arbustos fue significativamente mayor en sitios con alta heterogeneidad geomorfológica en comparación con sitios que exhibieron pocos cambios en las condiciones del terreno o del suelo. Variaciones en el aspecto y drenaje del suelo fueron indicadores especialmente importantes de la diversidad biótica.

	abstract = {Long-term discharge records (17–81 yr) of 78 streams from across the continental United States were analyzed to develop a general quantitative characterization of streamflow variability and predictability. Based on (1) overall flow variability, (2) flood regime patterns, and (3) extent of intermittency, 11 summary statistics were derived from the entire record for each stream. Using a nonhierarchical clustering technique, nine stream types were identified: harsh intermittent, intermittent flashy, intermittent runoff, perennial flashy, perennial runoff, snowmelt, snow + rain, winter rain, and mesic groundwater. Stream groups separated primarily on combined measures of intermittency, flood frequency, flood predictability, and overall flow predictability, and they showed reasonable geographic affiliation. A conceptual model that incorporates the nine stream clusters in a hierarchical structure is presented. Also, the positions of the 78 streams in a continuous three-dimensional flow space illustrate the wide range of ecologically important hydrologic variability that can constrain ecological and evolutionary processes in streams. Long-term daily streamflow records are a rich source of information with which to evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of lotic environments across many physiographic and ecographic regions. Relative positions of streams in flow space provide a conceptual framework for evaluating a priori the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors in regulating population and community processes and patterns.},

Among organisms inhabiting running waters, what adaptations exist for surviving floods and droughts? How will the alteration of the frequency, timing and duration of flow extremes affect flood- and drought-adapted organisms? How rapidly can populations evolve in response to altered flow regimes? Here, we identify three modes of adaptation (life history, behavioral and morphological) that plants and animals use to survive floods and/or droughts. The mode of adaptation that an organism has determines its vulnerability to different kinds of flow regime alteration. The rate of evolution in response to flow regime alteration remains an open question. Because humans have now altered the flow regimes of most rivers and many streams, understanding the link between fitness and flow regime is crucial for the effective management and restoration of running water ecosystems.},

Hydrologic alteration may promote new opportunities for nonnative species by creating novel habitats, modifying biotic interactions (including predation and competition), and promoting new dispersal pathways. Here, we review the relevant theory and current empirical evidence for additive, synergistic, and antagonistic interactions between hydrologic alteration and species invasions in flowing waters. Building on case studies of both animal and plant communities, we demonstrate the importance of the alteration-invasion nexus to mediate biotic interactions and alter food web structure via top-down and bottom-up effects. Finally, we describe how increasingly altered flow regimes and native-nonnative mixed communities pose a novel conservation challenge, and we explore emerging management strategies in highly-managed river basins.},

The 15 sites revealed a high diversity of unionids (10 species) and several rare and endangered taxa, including Pleurobema sintoxia (Rafinesque, 1820), Villosa iris (I. Lea, 1829), and Alasmidonta marginata (Say, 1818). Present survey results indicate an established unionid community with several taxa increasing their distributions compared to historical surveys. Upstream dispersal was halted at the Savan Dam at river kilometer 36.69. No live or dead unionids were found at six sites upstream of the dam. Bray-Curtis similarity indices were calculated between present survey and historical survey accounts. Species composition in the present survey compares favorably (86.14\%) with collections by Ortmann (1909) and Bogan and Davis (1992).

	abstract = {Over the past 25 years, unionid mussels in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have been adversely impacted by invasive dreissenid mussels, which directly (e.g., by attachment to unionid shells) and indirectly (e.g., by competing for food) cause mortality. Despite the invasion, unionids have survived in several areas in the presence of dreissenid mussels. We investigated current spatial patterns in these native mussel refuges based on surveys for unionid mussels across 48 sampling locations (141 sites) in 2011 and 2012, and documented species abundance and diversity in coastal areas of lakes St. Clair and Erie. The highest-quality assemblages of native mussels (densities, richness, and diversity) appear to be concentrated in the St. Clair delta, where abundance continues to decline, as well as in in Thompson Bay of Presque Isle in Lake Erie and in just a few coastal wetlands and drowned river-mouths in the western basin of Lake Erie. The discovery of several new refuge areas suggests that unionids have a broader distribution within the region than previously thought.},

We conducted river-wide surveys in French Creek, known for its mussel abundance, to quantify population-level indicators that could be used for measuring viability of Epioblasma torulosa rangiana (Northern Riffleshell), a critically imperiled freshwater mussel, in recovering or reintroduced populations. We estimated multiple attributes of Northern Riffleshell populations, including longitudinal distribution, densities and abundances, sex-specific age structure, and mortality rates. Northern Riffleshell has been documented in French Creek since at least the early 1900s and is distributed unevenly throughout the creek (12 of 32 sites in a bimodal pattern), with no animals found in the upper third of the creek. At sites containing Northern Riffleshell, site-specific densities ranged from 0.009–6.668 m2. Maximum age of Northern Riffleshell ranged from 7–11 years at four sites with evidence of sustained recruitment (i.e., uneven age structure). Proportions of individuals in each age class were similar at each site, even though total numbers of animals differed by up to two orders of magnitude. Significantly more males than females were found in early ages (1–3), but no significant differences were found in older age classes. There were no significant differences in mortality rates (both sexes combined) at all four sites. However, mortality rates differed significantly between the sexes at older ages (ages 6–10) at the one site with enough individuals for a comparison, suggesting greater reproductive costs or selective predation for females. The population attributes of Northern Riffleshell from French Creek are important benchmarks for setting restoration goals and measuring success in other systems that share a similar biogeography to French Creek, but whose fauna has been depleted (e.g., many Ohio River tributaries).},

	abstract = {The freshwater mussel (Unionidae: Bivalvia) communities of the French Creek watershed are nationally recognized for their importance to biodiversity. The goal of this research was to gather more information on the distribution and densities of these species throughout the river. This study utilized two-phase sampling with timed searches to characterize mussel species richness in a large number of sites and to calculate catch-per-unit-effort values. The results of the timed search were used to select a subset of sites for quantitative mussel surveys to estimate density and abundance. Starting in New York, the main stem of French Creek was divided into 5.6-km lengths, and one site was randomly chosen within each of those lengths, favoring habitat (large riffle/runs) for rare species and high species diversity. Snorkelers collected as many unionid individuals as possible, with a target search rate of 0.5 m2 min-1. Thirty-two main-stem sites were surveyed with timed searches. Mean species richness was 11.8 ({SE} = 0.94), and mean {CPUE} was 59.5 mussels per person-hour ({SE} = 9.32). Quantitative sampling was performed at ten sites using a double sampling design. Mean density estimates ranged from 0 to 27.98 m-2. Abundance estimates range from 0 to 69,848 live mussels per site. For the main stem, we calculated regression models to estimate densities and abundances at qualitatively sampled sites based on the {CPUE} at quantitatively sampled sites. Extrapolation yields approximately 22 million mussels in the 2.04 million m2 of large riffle-run habitat in the main stem of French Creek.},

We examined mussel diversity and abundance across 75 transects throughout navigational pools and recorded 21 live native mussel species, including federally endangered Pleurobema clava (Clubshell) and Epioblasma torulosa rangiana (Northern Riffleshell) and several species with state endangered or threatened status. Riverine species richness and counts were significantly higher in the most-upstream portions of the upper pools, indicating that areas with consistent flows and suitable substrate just downstream of the dams may provide refugia for riverine freshwater mussel species. Sand, gravel, cobble, boulder, and organic debris had significant positive effects on riverine and facultative counts, while clay, bedrock, and woody debris had significant negative effects. Silt and woody debris had significant negative effects on riverine species richness, and sand and gravel had significant positive effects. These data will help identify sensitive areas for future protection and provide baseline data for monitoring future trends. The protection of relatively shallow areas with suitable substrates not yet impacted by dredging operations will be important to sustain remaining freshwater mussel populations in these pools.},

Males gained significantly more mass than females over the first 50 days, but no difference in length was detected. Neonate S. catenatus returned to their general birthing area to overwinter.

	abstract = {Beaver Dam pond, created in the 1930s by damming Shaver Creek, was destroyed by floods in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, leaving a large wet meadow surrounded by forest and fed by Shaver Creek and numerous springs and seep tributaries. The Odonata fauna of this habitat in central Pennsylvania was first sampled in 1954 and has been revisited over 600 times since, mostly in the past three decades. The habitat succession has resulted in faunal changes. Aside from supporting populations of several Odonata species of conservation interest, it is remarkable in that the River Bluet (Enallagma anna), a damselfly with western affinities, colonized the site in 2006, the only known location for the species in Pennsylvania and south and east of southeastern Michigan and southern Ontario. We report the yearly and seasonal distribution of the 99 species documented at Beaver Dam and associated stream and wetlands through early 2011.},

	abstract = {Scrub oak barrens were once distributed throughout portions of the northeastern United States. This fire-dependent community covered over 809,000 ha in Pennsylvania during the mid-1900s, but was reduced to about 7132 ha by the late 1900s. Decline of scrub oak barrens is attributed to development, fire suppression, and colonization by fire-intolerant trees. Scrub oak barrens are a state imperiled ecosystem and in recent years, efforts to restore late successional barrens through mechanical cutting and prescribed fire have been initiated in Pennsylvania. Scrub oak barrens support high species richness, including several rare or declining species of plants and animals. This ecosystem is also known for supporting rare Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species. We used light traps and bait stations to compare Lepidoptera communities in restored and late successional scrub oak barrens in northeastern Pennsylvania. A total of 13,386 individuals were identified, representing 373 species. Nine species are state-listed, with four of these species detected exclusively in restored barrens. Few differences in Lepidoptera species richness, diversity, or abundance were found between restored and late successional barrens. Moth communities were similar across all sites and forb presence partially explained moth variance. Several species (n = 197) were found in both restored and late successional sites. However, several species were unique to restored (n = 128) and late successional sites (n = 48). Our findings suggest scrub oak barrens should be managed to create a mosaic of successional stages throughout the landscape if Lepidoptera diversity is a conservation goal.},

	abstract = {Erie Bluffs State Park in Erie County, Pennsylvania, established in 2004, occupies 219 ha along 2.25 km of Lake Erie shoreline. The park is notable for its highly erodible lakeshore bluffs, black oak sand barrens, and lakeplain swamp forests. A vascular plant inventory was undertaken and supplemented with historical collections to provide a vouchered checklist from the site now occupied by Erie Bluffs State Park. A second checklist with a list of unconfirmed records is based on unvouchered sightings from the park and specimen records from the vicinity of the park that cannot confidently be mapped within the park boundaries. The checklist includes 555 vascular taxa in 309 genera and 98 families with taxa representing the following groups: Equisetophyta (5), Lycopodiophyta (4), Pteridophyta (22), Coniferophyta (3), Liliopsida (136), and Magnoliopsida (385). Poaceae (56 species), Asteraceae (56 species), Cyperaceae (41 species), Rosaceae (36 species), and Brassicaceae (22 species) are the five largest families. The flora includes 391 species and subspecific taxa listed as native to Pennsylvania, and 159 that are introduced; the remaining five species are of uncertain native status. Twenty-three species are listed as species of concern, 19 represent Erie County records, and three are new to the flora of Pennsylvania. An additional 108 species are reported as unconfirmed records needing further inventory work. Plant communities are mapped and described. The vascular plant species of Erie Bluffs State Park are found among 14 natural communities and anthropogenic cover types, including 4 natural communities limited to the Great Lakes Region: Great Lakes Region Scarp Woodland; Great Lakes Bluff Seep; Elm–Ash–Maple Lakeplain Forest; and Black Oak Barrens.},

The United States is well positioned economically and politically to pursue habitat conservation should it be a societal goal. We assessed the {US} protected area portfolio with respect to biodiversity in the country. New synthesis maps for terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater fish, and trees permit comparison with protected areas to identify priorities for future conservation investment. Although the total area protected is substantial, its geographic configuration is nearly the opposite of patterns of endemism within the country. Most protected lands are in the West, whereas the vulnerable species are largely in the Southeast. Private land protections are significant, but they are not concentrated where the priorities are. To adequately protect the nation’s unique biodiversity, we recommend specific areas deserving additional protection, some of them including public lands, but many others requiring private investment.},

	abstract = {Understanding species–habitat relationships for endangered species is critical for their conservation. However, many studies have limited value for conservation because they fail to account for habitat associations at multiple spatial scales, anthropogenic variables, and imperfect detection. We addressed these three limitations by developing models for an endangered wetland bird, Yuma Ridgway's rail (Rallus obsoletus yumanensis), that examined how the spatial scale of environmental variables, inclusion of anthropogenic disturbance variables, and accounting for imperfect detection in validation data influenced model performance. These models identified associations between environmental variables and occupancy. We used bird survey and spatial environmental data at 2473 locations throughout the species' U.S. range to create and validate occupancy models and produce predictive maps of occupancy. We compared habitat-based models at three spatial scales (100, 224, and 500 m radii buffers) with and without anthropogenic disturbance variables using validation data adjusted for imperfect detection and an unadjusted validation dataset that ignored imperfect detection. The inclusion of anthropogenic disturbance variables improved the performance of habitat models at all three spatial scales, and the 224-m-scale model performed best. All models exhibited greater predictive ability when imperfect detection was incorporated into validation data. Yuma Ridgway's rail occupancy was negatively associated with ephemeral and slow-moving riverine features and high-intensity anthropogenic development, and positively associated with emergent vegetation, agriculture, and low-intensity development. Our modeling approach accounts for common limitations in modeling species–habitat relationships and creating predictive maps of occupancy probability and, therefore, provides a useful framework for other species.},

	url = {http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20191112},
	abstract = {Landsat satellites have been operating since 1972, providing a continuous global record of the Earth’s land surface. The imagery is currently available at no cost through the U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}). A previous {USGS} study estimated that Landsat imagery provided users an annual benefit of \$2.19 billion in 2011, with U.S. users accounting for \$1.79 billion of those benefits. That study, published in 2013, surveyed users in 2012 about Landsat imagery they retrieved in 2011. But since then, many changes have altered the demand for and supply of remotely sensed imagery and have made the analysis complex. This report updates these estimates, surveying users in 2018 about Landsat images they retrieved in 2017. The report discusses changes in the value per scene in 2017 when compared to 2011 and analyzes the potential consequences of charging fees. Landsat imagery has been available at no cost to the public since 2008, resulting in the distribution of millions of scenes each subsequent year. In addition, tens of thousands of Landsat users have registered with the {USGS} to access the data. Considering the number of Landsat data users worldwide and the broad range of Landsat data applications, it is difficult to quantify the cascading benefits to society provided by Landsat imagery. The value of Landsat imagery to these users was demonstrated by the substantial aggregated annual economic benefit from the imagery. Landsat imagery provided domestic and international users an estimated \$3.45 billion in benefits in 2017 compared to \$2.19 billion in 2011, with U.S. users accounting for \$2.06 billion of those benefits. Much of the societal value of Landsat stems from the free and open data policy that allows users to access as much imagery as is necessary for their analysis at no cost. Charging even small fees would result in a loss of users and, most likely, a steep decline in the amount of imagery downloaded. It is reasonable that more than 50 percent of users will decline to pay. The consequences of charging for Landsat imagery would be felt by downstream users as well, through increased prices for value-added products as well as more intangible effects, such as reduced monitoring of environmental hazards.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the population status of many marsh-dependent birds in North America but recent efforts have focused on collecting more reliable information and estimates of population trends. As part of that effort, a standardized survey protocol was developed in 1999 that provided guidance for conducting marsh bird surveys throughout North America such that data would be consistent among locations. The original survey protocol has been revised to provide greater clarification on many issues as the number of individuals using the protocol has grown. The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol instructs surveyors to conduct an initial 5-minute passive point-count survey followed by a series of 1-minute segments during which marsh bird calls are broadcast into the marsh following a standardized approach. Surveyors are instructed to record each individual bird from the suite of 26 focal species that are present in their local area on separate lines of a datasheet and estimate the distance to each bird. Also, surveyors are required to record whether each individual bird was detected within each 1-minute subsegment of the survey. These data allow analysts to use several different approaches for estimating detection probability. The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol provides detailed instructions that explain the field methods used to monitor marsh birds in North America.

	abstract = {We used Great Lakes hydrologic data and bird monitoring data from the Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program from 1995–2002 to: 1) evaluate trends and patterns of annual change in May–July water levels for Lakes Ontario, Erie, and Huron-Michigan, 2) report on trends of relative abundance for birds breeding in Great Lakes coastal marshes, and 3) correlate basin-wide and lake-specific annual indices of bird abundance with Great Lakes water levels. From 1995–2002, average May, June, and July water levels in all lake basins showed some annual variation, but Lakes Erie and Huron-Michigan had identical annual fluctuation patterns and general water level declines. No trend was observed in Lake Ontario water levels over this period. Abundance for five of seven marsh birds in Lake Ontario wetlands showed no temporal trends, whereas abundance of black tern (Chlidonias niger) declined and that of swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) increased from 1995–2002. In contrast, abundances of American coot (Fulica americana), black tern, common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), marsh wren (Cistorthorus palustris), pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), sora (Porzana carolina), swamp sparrow, and Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) declined within marshes at Lakes Erie and Huron/Michigan from 1995–2002. Annual abundances of several birds we examined showed positive correlations with annual lake level changes in non-regulated Lakes Erie and Huron/Michigan, whereas most birds we examined in Lake Ontario coastal wetlands were not correlated with suppressed water level changes of this lake. Overall, our results suggest that long-term changes and annual water level fluctuations are important abiotic factors affecting abundance of some marsh-dependent birds in Great Lakes coastal marshes. For this reason, wetland bird population monitoring initiatives should consider using methods in sampling protocols, or during data analyses, to account for temporal and spatial components of hydrologic variability that affect wetlands and their avifauna.},

	abstract = {Using data from 21,546 point counts conducted by volunteers in Bird Studies Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program, I assessed whether occupancy of 15 breeding marsh bird species increased or decreased throughout the southern portion of the Great Lakes basin between 1996 and 2013. I accounted for differences in detection probability, addressed spatial autocorrelation, and assessed whether initial occupancy in 1996 and subsequent colonization or extinction at a site within and across species was influenced by site, wetland, and landscape scale covariates. Occupancy of 9 of 15 (60\%) species significantly decreased, whereas occupancy of only 1 (7\%) species significantly increased. The results show the power of citizen science and suggest that the largest number of decreasing marsh-dependent breeding bird species will benefit from conserving, restoring, or creating large wetlands surrounded by limited urban land use, and from addressing issues within International Joint Commission Areas of Concern. Plus, individual or smaller groups of decreasing species will also benefit from conserving, restoring, or creating robust-emergent-dominated but interspersed, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)-free, Phragmites-free wetlands surrounded by higher proportions of wetland cover in the surrounding landscape, and from addressing issues within Great Lakes coastal wetlands. These actions will help promote colonization or reduce extinction and help slow or maybe even reverse declining trends in occupancy among decreasing species across the southern portion of the Great Lakes basin.},
